# Raspberry Pi Project
## Alarm System with Weather Email Alert
### Student ID: 2826587
#### Introduction
This project is making a useful daily system with Raspberry Pi 3. It is not only an alarm clock but also sends you weather emails. It's good for people to know the weather before going outside.

### Safety
When doing this project, we need to be careful with electricity. We always make sure to follow the safety rules.

### Building the System
The core of the system, the Raspberry Pi, ran on Raspbian OS. The initial phase involved the standard setup procedures such as flashing the OS onto an SD card and configuring the device for network connectivity.

The Raspberry Pi interfaced with an online weather service to fetch current weather data. The physical assembly was minimal, relying on internal software functions and online services rather than additional hardware components.

For the audible alarm functionality, a simple script was written to play an alarm sound through the Raspberry Pi’s audio output at the preset time.

The Code
The main part of the project was this nifty Python script that managed two things at once. It could grab web content, send emails, and make some noise—thanks to libraries like BeautifulSoup, smtplib, and pygame. Here's what it did:

It plays an alarm sound at the time we set.
At the same time, it gets weather data from the internet and sends it by email.
Problems and How We Solved Them
We had some problems during the project:

### Problems:

Pulling live data from the web was a head-scratcher.
Getting the script to run like clockwork (literally) was another noggin-nudger.
Configuring the email to send was also hard.
### Solutions:

We learned how to use requests and BeautifulSoup to get the weather data.
We used datetime and time libraries to help us run the alarm at the right time.
For email, we used smtplib and ssl to make sure emails send safely.
Future Plans
The alarm and weather email system is working now, but there are things to make better. For the future, I want to make the alarm sound more clear because now it is not very loud. I will find a better speaker to use. Also, I want to make the system send a warning email if the weather is very bad, like heavy rain or very hot. It is important for people to get this information fast.

### Video
We've got a whole showcase on video—setup, code, the whole nine yards:

### Conclusion
This project is finished now. Every morning, it can wake you up and tell you the weather by email. This can be very useful and help people to plan their day. I think many people will like this simple but helpful system. We will make it better and better, and hope it will be used by more people later.
